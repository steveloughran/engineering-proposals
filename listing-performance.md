# Maximing Hadoop API List performance (especially on object stores)


## Summary

* Embrace the incremental list operations for better scale and support of paged downloads (object storage), adopting 

* Try to do useful work in each iteration, to make the most of of clients which do asynchronous fetch
  of the next page of results.
* Be prepared for listing failures (AccessDenied, FileNotFound) to surface in that first `hasNext()`/`next()` call;
  as asynchronous IO may delay the problem being observed in the `list` operation.
* `RemoteIterator<T>` implementations which implement `Closeable` MUST be closed.
   That is as important for local `file://` filesystems as object stores.
* `RemoteIterator<T>` implementations which implement statistics collection can be queried for them
   on builds with the HADOOP-16830 API, *and* will print them in their `toString()` calls.
   Consider logging at debug to see those values.

## Avoid 
 * Discarding information and asking the FS for it later in `getFileStatus()` calls
 * `globStatus()`
 * Probing for directories existing (`getFileStatus()`, `exists()`, `isDirectory()`) 
  before executing the list call. Do the list, and expect failures to surface in the list call.
 
## Embrace

Use in order of preference

* `listFiles(path, recursive = true)`  -deep listing, avoids any simulation of directories.
   S3A: `O(files)` with async page fetch irrespective of directory structure;
   elsewhere incremental treewalk (which could do async work in future)

* `listFiles(path, recursive = false)` -shallow listing, potentially efficient.
* `listStatusIterator(path)` - a direct replacement for `FileSystem.listStatus(): FileStatus[]`

And for when you want store location: `listLocatedStatus()`.

Mapreduce `LocatedFileStatusFetcher` can retrieve files in parallel to build its list up (and will provide IOStatistics too). 
(`org.apache.hadoop.mapred.LocatedFileStatusFetcher`)
It is/will be tagged as @Public/@Unstable, because applications/librareies turn out to have been using it (hello Parquet!). 
It is/will be an `IOStatisticsSource` too, providing
stats on the list operations, though sadly not the `globStatus()` phase.

## How to Parallelise

How best to parallelise your own listing code, if you are doing it to treewalk

* Use an incremental list operation.
* Have a (limited) set of worker threads doing their own processing/scanning,
  reading from a blocking queue and feeding the results into another queue
* Feed the listing entries into the queue of child directories to scan. 
* Provide another `RemoteIterator<>` to access the results, reading from the result queue.
* Which should implement `Closeable.close()` if you want to allow faster abort of sequence from the reader.
* Otherwise: Add a way to stop the scan process.

Application code to :

* Go through the remote iterator, being prepared for failures to not surface until the first
* Do something with each entry, the better to make use of asynchronous fetching.
* Consider measuring list performance. Take a look at `org.apache.hadoop.util.DurationInfo` if
you want something minimal.


## Making the best use of `RemoteIterator<>` listings

1. Consider that the read may block on the initial `list` call, the `hasNext()` or the `next()` call.
1. There's some ambiguity as to when `FileNotFoundException` and similar events may surface(*). It may be
in the actual evaluation where `FileNotFoundException` surfaces, because it was only in an
asynchronous listing that the operation failed. 

Some iterators may be `Closeable` for a faster/cleaner shutdown of background IO.
Consider checking to see if they do, Closeable, cast and close, 
e,g through `IOUtils.cleanupWithLogger(LOGGER, (Closeable) it);`.

This isn't just for the object stores; once we hook the iterable
`java.nio.Files.newDirectoryStream(path)` listing to `listStatusIterator()`,
we will need to close `DirectoryStream` at the end to avoid leaking references.
The FS APIs can do all the passthrough, but the callers will need to wrap up. 


## RemoteIterators and IOStatistics


Once HADOOP-16380 is in, some `RemoteIterators` willimplement `IOStatisticSource`,
and, if invoked, may return either `null` or an `IOStatistics` implementation. 

Specifically: 

* The S3A listing operations will report on the number of http list/list-continuation requests made,
  and the mix/mean/max values.
* The mapping/transforming wrapper iterators in `org.apache.hadoop.util.functional` all
  implement `IOStatisticsSource` and will pass through the `getIOStatistics()` call.
  They will also forward `Closeable.close()`.

You can use `IOStatisticsLogging` to log these, or collect results into
an `IOStatisticsSnapshot` for aggregation and reporting. 
his snapshot is Serializable as java or JSON, so total statisics can be reported back. 

Without using the new API, consider logging the iterator's `.toString()` value at debug-level, if you
want to get performance statistics from them.


## Implementors notes 

### General

* Focus on `listStatus()` and `listLocatedStatus()`.

### Asynchronous listing

* Use a filesystem thread pool Rather than spin up threads of your own.
* Try to prefetch as much as you can.
* But be aware some code probes for a dir having children with a `listStatus(path).hasNext()` operation,
  so that initial scan may be something to make fast.
* Do not rely on `close()` being invoked.

### `IOStatistics`

* Collect statistics, report them through `IOStatistics` and `toString()`
* Especially for blocking/async IO operations against remote stores.
  Identifying listing-related latencies is invaluable for performance tuning query planning
* Wrap with `o.a.h.fs.functional.RemoteStatistics` wrappers,
  which pass through `IOStatistics` and `Closeable` APIs.
  You should be able to use these for most of your simple 1:1 map transformations
  &mdash; unless you need to do things with exception handling/transformation.
